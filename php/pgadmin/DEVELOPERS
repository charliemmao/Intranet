phpPgAdmin - Developer's Information

 phpPgAdmin is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it.
 Many great features have been written by other people and you too
 can help to make phpPgAdmin a useful tool.
 
 If you're planning to contribute source, please read the following 
 information:
 
 + All files include header.inc.php (layout), lib.inc.php (common functions)
   and config.inc.php. All configuration data belongs in config.inc.php. 
   Please keep it free from other code. 
   Commonly used functions should be added to lib.inc.php.
 + Obviously, you're free to use whatever coding style you want. But please
   try to keep your code as simple as possible: beginners are using phpPgAdmin
   as an example application.
 + Please try to keep up the file-naming conventions. Table-related stuff
   goes to tbl_*.php, db-related code to db_*.php and so on.
 + Please don't use verbose strings in your code, instead add the string
   (at least) to english.inc.php and echo it out. 
 + If you want to be really helpful, write an entry for the ChangeLog.
 
 IMPORTANT:
  The following method is preferred for new developers:
  - fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.greatbridge.org:/usr/local/cvsroot/phppgadmin login
    [Password: anonymous]
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.greatbridge.org:/usr/local/cvsroot/phppgadmin checkout phpPgAdmin
    [This will create a new sub-directory named phpPgAdmin]
  - add your stuff
  - send me the file(s) you've modified

  Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to developers who have already
  contributed something useful to phpPgAdmin.  If you're interested in that, 
  please contact me.

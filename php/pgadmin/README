  Credits:
  	This work is based on Tobias Ratschiller's phpMyAdmin for MySQL.  Major portions 
	have been ported to work with PostgreSQL and with that came much new code, however
	the concepts and ideas all (except User Administration and Postgres specific functionalitye) 
	came from phpMyAdmin.

    I used phpMyAdmin for several months at my last company.  After leaving the company, I 
	began to use PostgreSQL instead of MySQL and completely missed the amazing features 
	and funcitonality available in phpMyAdmin.  So what better to do than port it.
	
	phpMyAdmin in turn is based on Peter Kuppelwieser's MySQL-Webadmin. It was his idea 
    to create a web-based interface to MySQL using PHP3. Although Tobias did not
    used any of his source-code, there were some concepts borrowed from 
    him. phpMyAdmin was created because Peter told Tobias he wasn't going to further 
    develop his (great) tool.
	
    Thanks go to 
	  - Tobias Ratschiller <tobias@dnet.it> for phpMyAdmin which was a marvelously written program.
	  - Rob Casson <rob@styro.lib.muohio.edu> who originally ported phpMyAdmin.  Although I didn't use
	    any of his code, he inspired me to work on a complete port of all the functionality.
	  - Marcellus Barrus <mbarrus@acucore.com> for some bug fixes and lots of debugging
	  - Brian Budnick <brian@utrave.org> for comments/suggestions and debugging

    And thanks to everyone else who sent me email with suggestions, bug-reports and
    or just some feedback.

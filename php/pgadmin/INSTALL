phpPgAdmin - Installation

  Preface:
    phpPgAdmin can administer a whole PostgresSQL-server (needs a super-user) 
    but also a single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need
    a properly set up a PostgresSQL-user who can read/write only the desired
    database. It's up to you to look up the appropiate part in the 
    PostgresSQL manual.

  Quick Install:
    [1] Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories)
        tar xvf phpPgAdmin_x.x.x.tar.gz
    [2] Open the file config.inc.php in your favorite editor and change
        the values for host, user and password to fit your environment.
        Have a look at Documentation.html for an explanation of all values.
    [3] It is recommended that you protect the directory in which
        you installed phpPgAdmin (unless it's on a closed intranet), 
        if you are not using adv_auth.
    [4] Open the file <www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>/index.php
        in your browser. phpPgAdmin should now display a welcome screen 
        and your databases or a login screen, depending on your 
		authentication method.

  Installation notes:
  + It is highly suggested that you create a user to use in 
    your config.inc.php file.  This user should have select access on the 
	pg_user table and no other permissions.
  + Be sure to protect the phpPgAdmin-directory. By default, it is not 
    protected in any way! It shouldn't be readable by anyone and 
    especially not by search-engines. Although there is a "nofollow" 
    directive on every page, there may be search-engines that don't 
    care about that and still follow the links on the page. 
    Think of AltaVista following a link named "Drop Database"

    http://deepthought.texsci.edu/protected_dirs.html
  + PHP should be configured to have magic_quotes=on. In the module
    version of PHP this can also be set on a per-directory base with 
    php_magic_quotes_gpc on in an .htaccess file or in your Apache's
    access.conf.
  + If you don't use the extension ".php" for your scripts, you can use
    the bundled script "extchg.sh" to modify phpPgAdmin (or any other script)
    to work with a different extension. Beware though, that currently changing 
    the extension from .html to something other won't work (it'd change all 
    "string".htmlspecialchars() constructs).
    
  + IMPORTANT: If you want to use the cfgUsePass and cfgUseExpire settings,
    be sure to set the respective items in psql or do not set these variables to 
	true until after you have updated the values through the User Admin
